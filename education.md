# **About Hugging Face for Education**

As an Open Source company democratizing Machine Learning, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) believes it is essential to educate people from all backgrounds worldwide.

Since March 2022 and the [ML demo.cratization tour](https://www.notion.so/ML-Demo-cratization-tour-with-66847a294abd4e9785e85663f5239652), experts from Hugging Face have taught hands-on classes on *How to Build Machine Learning Collaboratively* to more than 1000 students from 16 countries. Our new goal: we aim to teach Machine Learning to 1 million people by the end of 2023.

*This blog post describes what is behind Hugging Face for Education.*

## ü§ó¬†**Education for All**

üó£Ô∏è Our goal is to make the potential and limitations of Machine Learning understandable to everyone. We believe that doing so will help evolve the field in a direction where the application of these technologies will lead to net benefits for society as a whole.

- We describe in a very accessible way all [the uses of ML models](https://huggingface.co/tasks) (summarization, text generation, object detection‚Ä¶),
- We allow everyone to try all the ML models online without technical skills ([example](https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment)),
- We warn against the harmful biases identified in some systems (like [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2#limitations-and-bias)).
- We display open-source [ML apps](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and allow everyone to understand the potential of ML in one click.

## ü§ó¬†**Education for Trainees**

üó£Ô∏è We want to allow software engineers to turn into Machine Learning engineers quickly with online learning, hands-on workshops, and other innovative techniques.

- We provide [training courses](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) about natural language processing (NLP) and more domains (soon) using libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem as well as the Hugging Face Hub. It‚Äôs completely free and without ads. The ultimate goal of this course is to learn how to apply Transformers to (almost) any Machine Learning problem!
- We provide a [book](https://transformersbook.com/), written by experts at Hugging Face, on Transformers and their applications to a wide range of NLP tasks.

## ü§ó¬†**Education for Instructors**

üó£Ô∏è We want to empower educators with tools and offer collaborative spaces where students can build ML using open-source technologies and state-of-the-art ML models.

- We‚Äôve assembled [a toolkit](https://github.com/huggingface/education-toolkit) that instructors of Machine Learning or Data Science can use to easily prepare labs, homework, or classes. The content is self-contained so that it can be easily incorporated into an existing curriculum. This content is free and uses well-known Open Source technologies (transformers, gradio, etc). Feel free to pick a tutorial and teach it!

- We're organizing a dedicated, free workshop (June 6) on how to teach our educational resources in your ML and data science classes. Do not hesitate to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-teach-open-source-machine-learning-tools-tickets-310980931337).
- We are currently doing a worldwide tour in collaboration with university instructors to teach more than 10000 students one of our core topics: How to build ML collaboratively? You can request someone on the Hugging Face team to run the session for your class via the [ML demo.cratization tour initiative](https://www.notion.so/ML-Demo-cratization-tour-with-66847a294abd4e9785e85663f5239652)**.**

## ü§ó¬†**Education Events & News**
